# Code of Conduct

PyTexas is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference
participants in any form.

## Abridged Version

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and
sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for PyTexas.
