2023 was a busy year for the PyTexas Foundation, from our annual conference, 
launching new websites, and establishing a new virtual meetup the Foundation was 
active all year.

## 2023

### PyTexas 2023 Conference

The 17th annual PyTexas Conference was held on April 1st - 2nd, 2023 in Austin, 
Texas at the Austin Central Public Library. Brandon Rhodes and Andrew "Pandy" Knight 
delivered the opening keynotes each morning respectively, and 17 speakers from 
across the state and nation presented.

We checked-in 141 attendees this year, 84% of attendees residing in Texas and 66% 
being first time attendees. Various roles were represented amongst the attendees 
but the majority of attendees this year were software engineers with 50% of attendees 
having 7+ years of experience.

At the end of the conference, we announced that PyTexas 2024 will be held at the same
location April 19th - 21st, 2024.

### Launch of the PyTexas Foundation Websites and a Unified Tech Stack

For many years the Board Members have discussed creating a PyTexas Foundation
website. We also wanted to decide on a unified tech stack for all PyTexas assets.
We wanted to consolidate deployments to a single platform, use static site generators
whenever possible, and establish a unified set of tools and processes for building
PyTexas assets. Being a low-revenue non-profit organization, anything that was
free was preferred.

We decided to go with [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the 
[Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) extension for our static 
site generator. The projects are open-source and built using Python. All static
sites are hosted via GitHub pages using GitHub actions for CI. This year we launched
the [PyTexas Foundation Website](https://pytexas.org), the [PyTexas Conference Website](https://pytexas.org/2024), and the [PyTexas Meetup Website](https://pytexas.org/meetup).

A huge shout out to Laura Santamaria for her efforts in leading this transition.

### Expansion of the PyTexas Community Discord

In 2022 we launched a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jNPAbcNukj) to replace
our defunct Slack workspace for community engagement. With Slack announcing the
limitation on message retention we decided the move was necessary. While we
made the move in 2022, it wasn't until 2023 that we started to see people actually
engaging in the server. We now host our monthly meetup there (more below), a weekly
Friday hangout, and have various text channels for discussion.

### PyTexas Meetup

After various discussions with Texas Pythonistas we discovered that Texas was missing
a vital piece of its meetup ecosystem. Many local meetups had yet to make a return
and many who did have a local meetup lived too far away to make it to the meetup
consistently. For those who aren't aware, Texas is a _huge_ state. Major cities
such as Dallas and Houston are large enough that traversing from one side to the 
other can take multiple hours by car. In response, a few of the PyTexas Conference 
organizers decided to start a PyTexas Virtual Meetup that is held once a month
in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jNPAbcNukj). We had our first meetup
on September 12, 2023, and have settled into holding our Monthly Meetup on the 
first Tuesday of the month at 8:00pm CST (except when there is a holiday conflict, in which
case we will move to the second Tuesday).

## 2024 and Beyond

2022 was a recovery year, 2023 was a foundational building year, 2024 will _hopefully_
be an expansion year.

### The Goal

The goal of the PyTexas Foundation is and will continue to be the stewardship
of the Texas Python Community. Our goal is to not only put on our own events,
but be able to informationally, instrumentally, and financially support other Python
based events within the great state of Texas (and hopefully not just within the
major cities).

### Next Steps 

#### **PyTexas 2024 Conference and Meetups**

The Annual PyTexas 2024 Conference will be held April 19 - 21, 2024 in Austin,
Texas at the Austin Central Public Library. This will be the first year since 2017
where the conference will have tutorials the day before the main conference.
Early Bird tickets are currently on sale [on our website](https://pytexas.org/2024)
and the CFP closed January 14, 2024.

The PyTexas Meetup will continue to host its monthly meetup. If you'd like to
speak at the meetup, fill out the form [on the meetup site homepage](https://www.pytexas.org/meetup/)

#### **Secure More Funding**

For nearly the entirety of its lifetime, the conference was the Foundation's
only expense and fundraising event via sponsorships. With the expansion into 
meetups and the eventual goal of supporting local meetups we have to rethink our 
fundraising efforts. We hope to be able to roll out a sponsorship package for
sponsoring the PyTexas Meetup and even the Foundation overall within this coming
year, so keep an eye on our website and socials for its announcement.

#### **Increase Awareness Through Marketing**
This mostly means more social media awareness. We're going to experiment with
paid LinkedIn ads leading up to the PyTexas Conference in April. We will evaluate
the performance of these ads and decide if we use them going forward for both
the conference and meetup.

#### **Foster the Return of Local Python Meetups**

It's no secret that the COVID-19 Pandemic decimated local meetups across the world.
Many attempted to move to a virtual format, fewer survived. The meetup scene
slowly started to return to normal in 2023 and we're hoping we'll be able to 
help Python Meetups within Texas return to their 2019 levels. Whether this is 
through mentoring new organizers to restart defunct meetups, helping find sponsors,
speakers, or venues, or sponsoring financially for Meetup.com subscriptions and
event food, the Foundation is here to support all Python related meetups in Texas
as best we can.

If you are running a Python-based meetup in Texas (Python User Group, PyLadies, 
Django User Group, Python Web User Group, etc.) please reach out to us either
via [email](mailto:foundation@pytexas.org) or join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jNPAbcNukj) 
and message us there.

#### **Possible Single Day Unconference in the Fall**

We've recently talked about holding a 1-day Unconference event in the Fall as
an experiment to see if it's something the Python Texas Community is interested
in. 

If you're unaware, an Unconference is an event where there are no scheduled talks.
The entire conference functions like an Open Spaces or Birds of a Feather session.
We would provide a few different rooms and attendees would come with topics they
wish to speak about and conduct round-table discussions in the room on the topic
for 30-45 minutes, for a few sessions a day. These types of events are popular in
the DevOps Days space and we'd love to get them going here.

If this is of interest to you, join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jNPAbcNukj)
and let us know!

## Conclusion

We at the PyTexas Foundation are excited to continue to grow and support the Python
Community within the state of Texas. Every day the number of people participating
in the discord, attending our events, and volunteering to help increases. 

We hope you'll join us on this journey.
