<h2>
Talk:
What to Do When the Bug Is in Someone Else's Code
</h2>
<p>
When there’s a bug in a library you are using it’s easy to feel stuck or to accrue a lot of technical debt trying to work around it. In this talk, I’ll go over strategies for solving both your short-term needs (fix it!) and your long term needs (not more technical debt…).

## Talk: Am I a bad person? Beginner mistakes with privacy and ownership
<p>
GDPR shook things up for tech in 2018. CCPA is doing the same. It’s our responsibility to respect our users’ data. But as beginners, sometimes we don’t know better. We’ll walk through morally grey mistakes I’ve made when creating client-facing Flask apps and how to fix them up like a good netizen.

<h2>
Talk:
The Humble-ish Decorator
</h2>
<p>
In this talk, we’ll look at why decorators exist, and how simple decorators work. We’ll look at how some more popular decorators in Python do what they do. Finally, we’ll look at how to harness decorators to do unexpected and potentially horrible things with Python. After this talk, you’ll know how decorators work, how to write your own decorators, and how decorators enable you to do extremely weird things in Python. Most importantly, you’ll understand how to use decorators responsibly, and definitely not to confuse your friends and colleagues.

<h2>
Talk:
Everyday Design Patterns: Facade Pattern
</h2>
<p>
Directly integrating dependencies into business logic couples our code to something we do not control. Changes made to upstream packages require us to update integration code across the project. This talk demonstrates how the Facade pattern can improve software design and simplify testing.

<h2>
Talk:
How Decorators Function
</h2>
<p>
Have you ever seen those “@” tags on top of Python functions and classes? Those are decorators - functions that wrap around other functions. Confusing? At first, but they’re easy with practice. Useful? Very! We’ll learn how they work, how to write our own, and how and when to use them.

The Amazing Mutable, Immutable Tuple and Other Philosophic Digressions

From the ISP, to the Enterprise, and now into the land of Hosting and Cloud, I have always been a trusted adviser to my customers and a mentor to my peers. Starting at an Internet Support Desk in 2007, I quickly fell in love with networking. Judging by the number of Cisco Press and O'Reilly books on my iPad, it's still going strong. I am the kind of nerd who had his own 48U rack full of routers, switches, and servers (at least until virtualization caught up with Network devices). I read technical books in my free time, and love to watch the drama on the IETF or NANOG mailing lists.
