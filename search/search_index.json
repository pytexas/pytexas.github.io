PyTexas 2020 was originally planned as an in-person event that shifted to virtual out of necessity. In 2021 the organizers decided to take a hiatus and evaluate the situation again in 2022. In 2022, PyTexas was the first Python conference globally to come back in-person in March, just prior to PyCon US in Salt Lake City. At that time, funding and staffing were severely limited, so we were unable to do a hybrid experience. These limitations continued into 2023, leading to a in-person only conference for both years.</p> <p>However, in 2024, we were finally staffed and financially stable enough to experiment with a hybrid conference. We decided to take a more novel approach and run our hybrid conference through the PyTexas Discord Server. We have been building a community on Discord since 2022, which now hosts our virtual meetup, so we thought it would be a good experiment to hold our virtual conference there. </p> <p>We are happy to report that our hybrid conference was a success. We sold 43 virtual tickets, and attendees who had an in-person ticket were also able to join the virtual experience. We had many in-person attendees thank us for this experience, as some had to step out for brief periods and were still able to attend the conference.</p> <p>One thing we strived for this year was to blend the in-person and virtual experience as much as possible so attendees from both would be able to interact with each other.  We did this a few ways. First, we encouraged people to chat in a conference-specific Discord text chat. Both in-person and virtual attendees engaged with each other and bridged the gap. We were very pleased with the level of interaction that was occurring. Next, we used Slido for all speaker questions. This decision was highly praised by both attendees and speakers alike. Slido allowed us to have attendees, either remote or in-person, ask questions to the speaker during their talk. Other attendees could see these questions and  upvote the ones they also wanted to ask. We had our organizers moderating the  questions and approving them prior to being visible, which allowed us to ensure safety for our speakers and attendees. The questions were then asked into the microphone on stage by our emcees, allowing the speaker to answer and the question to be recorded on video. This sped up our Q&amp;A portion and made speakers feel  more comfortable answering questions.</p> <p>Overall, the hybrid experience was a success, and we look forward to continuing with it in the future. </p>"},{"location":"blog/2024-conference-recap/#tutorials","title":"Tutorials","text":"<p>Tutorials are not new to the PyTexas Conference, but it is the first time we've  had tutorials since 2017.  Long-time attendee, speaker, and Keynoter  Andrew \"Pandy\" Knight  and organizer Mason Egger delivered the tutorials this year. We did not hold an open CFP for tutorials this year, but instead preselected our presenters. We made this choice because we weren't sure what the turnout would be for the tutorials, so we decided to select people who are known PyTexas regulars who would attend either way and were willing to take the gamble on attendance. </p> <p>Fortunately, tutorials were a smashing success. We sold 97 tutorial tickets this year,  which were an add-on to the main conference and gave access to both tutorials. Nearly every tutorial ticket holder checked in and attended at least one tutorial, with the vast majority attending both. </p> <p>The community reaction to tutorials was universally strong and we're excited to bring tutorials back next year.

So what do we think moved the needle?</p> <p>Our hypothesis is, that after two years of running a demographic survey at registration, we now have enough data to show who attends PyTexas. PyTexas does not give out any PII, but we included things like roles, years of experience, and size of company in our prospectus this year. To our surprise, as you can see in the graphs prior, the PyTexas Conference is a surprisingly senior level conference.  It's a great opportunity to get your product in front of engineers who may have influence on its usage in their company.</p> <p>Another hypothesis is that we made the prospectus as easy to find as possible. For so many years we had a link to a PDF of our prospectus with a big button that says Download our prospectus and every year I would get emails asking for people to send me the prospectus. This year I received 0 of those emails. Is it really that simple? Make your prospectus an HTML page and don't make someone download it, then attach it to an email internally, or worse they send the link and the next person in the chain has to download it too. I would love if another conference could experiment with this and let us know the results.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025-conference-recap/#finances","title":"Finances","text":"<p>PyTexas 2025 cost $48,633.17 to operate.

We sold 319 tickets of varying cost, including add-ons such as shirts &amp; swag, tutorials, and the after party, and made $31,884.00 in gross revenue (prior to fees).

To us, this speaks volumes to the strength of the community we are building. For reference, this year we had a 60% new attendee rate. In 2024 that number was 70%. That's quite the shift in only the course of a year. Not only do you like us enough to come back, you want other people to know you've been here before and that means the world to us.</p> <p>Second, we are seeing our community expand beyond Texas. We have \"regulars\" now who don't live in Texas. They come back because of the community we have and that also makes us over the moon excited. Y'all means all.</p> <p>Third, it seems a lot more Pythonistas are being health conscious this year, as our fruit and healthy snacks (sugar free sodas and seltzer) disappeared at an exponentially quicker rate than our non-healthy snacks. As someone who is also personally taking the steps to take better care of their health, I'm right there with you.  You may have heard the organizers talk about bananas at some point. I don't know what it is about that particular fruit, but people seem to love it.  We estimate we went through &gt; 50lbs of bananas over the course of the conference. Doing the math, that means everyone at the conference ate, on average, at least one banana. The poor cashier at HEB gave us the weirdest look... But keep it up! We hear you, and we'll adjust next years refreshments.</p> <p>Fourth, people networked so much this year. We saw so many people switching tables, going on walks around the lake, and just mingling. We saw a group of students who attended for the first time last year go up and talk to our previous keynote speaker and catch up with her. We saw coworkers who work remotely fly in to the conference to use this as an opportunity to meet. And we saw friends who hadn't seen each other since the last PyTexas Conference catch up on life after a year.</p> <p>Finally, y'all made it a point to tell us how awesome the conference was. Don't get me wrong, people do this every year and let me tell you, it's what keeps us going some nights. But this year the outpouring of love for the conference was monumental. And from the bottom of our hearts, we thank you for it.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025-conference-recap/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>The 2025 PyTexas conference will definitely go down as one of the most memorable conferences we've had yet.</p> <p>All recordings of the talks can be found on the PyTexas 2025 website or on our YouTube Channel.</p> <p>Be sure you join us for the 20th year of PyTexas next year!

If special legal counsel determines that indemnification is permissible, authorization of indemnification and determination of reasonableness of expenses will be made as specified by subparagraph (a)(iii), above, governing selection of special legal counsel. A provision contained in the certificate of formation, or a resolution of members or the Board that requires the indemnification permitted by paragraph 8.01, above, constitutes sufficient authorization of indemnification even though the provision may not have been adopted or authorized in the same manner as the determination that indemnification is permissible.</p> <p>(c) The Corporation will advance expenses before final disposition of a proceeding only after it determines that the facts then known would not preclude indemnification. The determination that the facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude indemnification and authorization of payment will be made in the same manner as a determination that indemnification is permissible under subparagraph (a), above.</p> <p>In addition to this determination, the Corporation may advance expenses only after it receives a written affirmation and undertaking from the person to receive the advance. The person's written affirmation will state that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under these Bylaws. The written undertaking will provide for repayment of the amounts advanced by the Corporation if it is ultimately determined that the person has not met the requirements for indemnification.
