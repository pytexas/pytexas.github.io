# Bylaws Of The PyTexas Foundation
 
These Bylaws govern the affairs of the PyTexas Foundation, a nonprofit corporation.

## ARTICLE 1 - OFFICES
 
### 1.01 Principal Office

The Corporation's principal office in Texas will be located at such place as the Board of Directors may determine. The Corporation may have such other offices, in Texas or elsewhere, as the Board of Directors may determine. The Board may change the location of any office of the Corporation.
 
### 1.02 Registered Office and Registered Agent

The Corporation will maintain a registered office and registered agent in Texas. The registered office may, but need not, be identical with the Corporation's principal office in Texas. The Board may change the registered office and the registered agent as permitted in the Texas Business Organizations Code.

## ARTICLE 2 - BOARD OF DIRECTORS
 
### 2.01 Management of Corporation
 
The Board will manage corporate affairs.
 
### 2.02 Number, Qualifications, and Tenure of Directors
 
The number of Directors will be a number determined by the Board that is not less than three and not greater than fifteen.  Directors must be Texas residents.  Each director will serve for a term of two years.  The directors' terms will be staggered so that the terms of half of the directors will begin in even-numbered years; the terms of the other half, in odd-numbered years.
 
### 2.03 Nominating Directors

At any meeting at which the election of a director is held, a director may nominate a person with the second of any other director. 
 
### 2.04 Electing Directors
 
A person who meets the qualifications for director and who has been duly nominated may be elected as a director. Directors will be elected by the vote of the Board. Each director will hold office until a successor is elected and qualifies. A director may be elected to succeed himself or herself as director.
 
### 2.05 Vacancies

The Board will fill any vacancy in the Board and any director position to be filled due to an increase in the number of directors. A vacancy is filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even if it is less than a quorum of the Board, or if it is a sole remaining director. A director selected to fill a vacancy will serve for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor in office.
 
### 2.06 Annual Meeting

The annual meeting of the Board may be held without notice other than these Bylaws. The annual Board meeting will be held on the weekend of the annual PyTexas conference at its location, or on the last Friday in August of each year at the corporation’s registered office in Texas, if no annual conference is scheduled. 
 
### 2.07 Regular Meetings

The Board may provide for regular meetings by resolution stating the time and place of such meetings. The meetings may be held anywhere inside Texas, and will be held at the Corporation's registered office in Texas if the resolution does not specify the location of the meetings. No notice of regular Board meetings is required other than a Board resolution stating the time and place of the meetings.
 
### 2.08 Special Meetings

Special Board meetings may be called by, or at the request of, the president or any two directors. A person or persons authorized to call special meetings of the Board may fix any place within Texas as the place for holding a special meeting. The person or persons calling a special meeting will inform the secretary of the corporation of the information to be included in the notice of the meeting. The secretary of the Corporation will give notice to the directors as these Bylaws require.
 
### 2.09 Notice

For meetings to be conducted in person, written or printed notice of any special meeting of the Board will be delivered to each director not less than seven, nor more than thirty days before the date of the meeting.  For meetings to be conducted remotely, as provided for by paragraphs 10.01 and 10.02,  written or printed notice of any special meeting of the Board will be delivered to each director not less than 48 hours, nor more than fifteen days before the time of the meeting.  The notice will state the place, day, and time of the meeting; who called it; and the purpose or purposes for which it is called.
 
### 2.10 Quorum

A majority of the number of directors then in office constitutes a quorum for transacting business at any Board meeting. The directors present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business even if enough directors leave the meeting so that less than a quorum remains. However, no action may be approved without the vote of at least a majority of the number of directors required for a quorum. If a quorum is never present at any time during a meeting, a majority of the directors present may adjourn and reconvene the meeting once without further notice.
 
### 2.11 Duties of Directors

Directors will discharge their duties, including any duties as committee members, in good faith, with ordinary care, and in a manner they reasonably believe to be in the Corporation's best interest. In this context, the term "ordinary care" means the care that ordinarily prudent persons in similar positions would exercise under similar circumstances. In discharging any duty imposed or power conferred on directors, directors may, in good faith, rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, concerning the Corporation or another person that has been prepared or presented by a variety of persons, including officers and employees of the Corporation, professional advisors or experts such as accountants or legal counsel. A director is not relying in good faith if he or she has knowledge concerning a matter in question that renders reliance unwarranted.
 
Directors are not deemed to have the duties of trustees of a trust with respect to the Corporation or with respect to any property held or administered by the Corporation, including property that may be subject to restrictions imposed by the donor or transferor of the property.
 
### 2.12 Duty to Avoid Improper Distributions
 
Directors who vote for or assent to improper distributions are jointly and severally liable to the Corporation for the value of improperly distributed assets, to the extent that, as a result of the improper distribution or distributions, the corporation lacks sufficient assets to pay its debts, obligations, and liabilities. Any distribution made when the Corporation is insolvent, other than in payment of corporate debts, or any distribution that would render the Corporation insolvent, is an improper distribution. A distribution made during liquidation without payment and discharge of or provision for payment and discharge of all known debts, obligations, and liabilities is also improper. Directors present at a Board meeting at which the improper action is taken are presumed to have assented, unless they dissent in writing. The written dissent must be filed with the secretary of the Corporation before adjournment of the meeting in question or mailed to the secretary by registered mail immediately after adjournment.
 
A director is not liable if, in voting for or assenting to a distribution, the director (1) relies in good faith and with ordinary care on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, prepared or presented by one or more officers or employees of the Corporation; legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the director reasonably believes are within the person's professional or expert competence; or a committee of the Board of which the director is not a member; (2) while acting in good faith and with ordinary care, considers the Corporation's assets to be at least that of their book value; or (3) in determining whether the Corporation made adequate provision for paying, satisfying, or discharging all of its liabilities and obligations, relied in good faith and with ordinary care on financial statements or other information concerning a person who was or became contractually obligated to satisfy or discharge some or all of these liabilities or obligations. Furthermore, directors are protected from liability if, in exercising ordinary care, they acted in good faith and in reliance on the written opinion of an attorney for the Corporation.
 
Directors held liable for an improper distribution are entitled to contribution from persons who accepted or received the improper distributions knowing they were improper. Contribution is in proportion to the amount received by each such person.
 
### 2.13 Delegating Duties

Directors may select advisors and delegate duties and responsibilities to them, such as the full power to buy or otherwise acquire stocks, bonds, securities, and other investments on the Corporation's behalf; and to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the Corporation's assets and properties at a time and for a consideration that the advisor deems appropriate. The directors have no liability for actions taken or omitted by the advisor if the Board acts in good faith and with ordinary care in selecting the advisor. The Board may remove or replace the advisor at any time and without any cause whatsoever.
 
### 2.14 Interested Directors

Contracts or transactions between directors, officers, or members who have a financial interest in the matter are not void or voidable solely for that reason. Nor are they void or voidable solely because the director, officer, or member is present at or participates in the meeting that authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because the interested party's votes are counted for the purpose. However, every director with any personal interest in the transaction must disclose all material facts concerning the transaction, including all potential personal benefit and potential conflicts of interest, to the other members of the Board or other group authorizing the transaction. The transaction must be approved by a majority of the uninterested directors or other group with the authority to authorize the transaction.
 
### 2.15 Actions of Board of Directors

The Board will try to act by consensus. However, if a consensus is not available, the vote of a majority of directors present and voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present is enough to constitute the act of the Board, unless the act of a greater number is required by law or by some other provision of these Bylaws. A director who is present at a meeting and abstains from a vote is considered to be present and voting for the purpose of determining the Board's decision. For the purpose of determining the decision of the Board, a director who is represented by proxy in a vote is considered present.
 
### 2.16 Proxies
 
A director may vote by proxy. All proxies must be in writing, must bear the signature of the director giving the proxy, and must be bear the date on which the proxy was executed by the director. No proxy is valid after three months from the date of its execution.
 
### 2.17 Compensation
 
Directors may receive salaries for their services. The Board may adopt a resolution providing for paying directors a fixed sum and expenses of attendance, if any, for attending each Board meeting. A director may serve the Corporation in any other capacity and receive compensation for those services. Any compensation that the Corporation pays to a director will be reasonable and commensurate with the services performed.
 
### 2.18 Removing Directors

The Board may vote to remove a director at any time with or without cause.  A meeting to consider removing a director may be called and noticed following the procedures provided in these Bylaws for a special meeting of the Board of Directors. The notice of the meeting will state that the issue of possibly removing the director will be on the agenda.
 
At the meeting, the director may present evidence of why he or she should not be removed and may be represented by an attorney at and before the meeting. Also, at the meeting, the Corporation will consider possible arrangements for resolving the problems that are in the mutual interest of the Corporation and the director.
 
A director may be removed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board.
 
## ARTICLE 3 - OFFICERS
 
### 3.01 Officer Positions
 
The Corporation's officers will be a president, a secretary, a vice president, and a treasurer.

The same person may hold any two or more offices, except for president and secretary.

A committee will include one or more directors and may include persons who are not directors. If the Board delegates any of its management authority to a committee, the majority of the committee will consist of directors. The Board may also delegate to the president its power to appoint and remove members of a committee that has not been delegated any management authority of the Board. The Board may establish qualifications for membership on a committee.

Establishing a committee or delegating authority to it will not relieve the Board, or any individual director, of any responsibility imposed by these Bylaws or otherwise imposed by law. No committee has the authority of the Board to:
 
(a) Amend the certificate of formation or articles of incorporation.

The following committee is authorized: Annual Conference Committee. The Board will define the activities and scope of authority of the committee by resolution.
 
### 4.03 Term of Office
 
Each committee member will continue to serve on the committee until a successor is appointed. However, a committee member's term may terminate earlier if the committee is terminated, or if the member dies, ceases to qualify, resigns, or is removed as a member. A vacancy on a committee may be filled by an appointment made in the same manner as an original appointment. A person appointed to fill a vacancy on a committee will serve for the unexpired portion of the terminated committee member's term.
 
### 4.04 Chair and Vice-Chair

One member of each committee will be designated as the committee chair, and another member of each committee will be designated as the vice-chair. The chair and vice-chair will be appointed by the president. The chair will call and preside at all meetings of the committee. When the chair is absent, cannot act, or refuses to act, the vice-chair will perform the chair's duties. When a vice-chair acts for the chair, the vice-chair has all the powers of--and is subject to all the restrictions on--the chair.
 
### 4.05 Notice of Meetings
 
For meetings to be conducted in person, written or printed notice of any meeting of the committee will be delivered to each committee member not less than seven, nor more than thirty days before the date of the meeting.  For meetings to be conducted remotely, as provided for by paragraphs 10.01 and 10.02 of these Bylaws,  written or printed notice of any meeting of the committee will be delivered to each committee member not less than 48 hours, nor more than fifteen days before the time of the meeting.  The notice will state the place, day, and time of the meeting; who called it; and the purpose or purposes for which it is called.
 
### 4.06 Quorum
 
One half of the number of committee members constitutes a quorum for transacting business at any meeting of the committee. The committee members present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business even if enough committee members leave the meeting so that less than a quorum remains. However, no action may be approved without the vote of at least a majority of the number of committee members required for a quorum. If a quorum is never present at any time during a meeting, the chair may adjourn and reconvene the meeting once without further notice.
 
### 4.07 Actions of Committees

Committees will try to take action by consensus. However, if a consensus is not available, the vote of a majority of committee members present and voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present is enough to constitute the act of the committee unless the act of a greater number is required by statute or by some other provision of these Bylaws.  A committee member who is present at a meeting and abstains from a vote is considered to be present and voting for the purpose of determining the act of the committee.
 
### 4.08 Proxies
 
A committee member may not vote by proxy.
 
### 4.09 Compensation

Committee members may receive salaries for their services. The Board may adopt a resolution providing for paying committee members a fixed sum and expenses of attendance, if any, for attending each meeting of the committee. A committee member may serve the Corporation in any other capacity and receive compensation for those services. Any compensation that the Corporation pays to a committee member will be reasonable and commensurate with the services performed.

Each committee may adopt its own rules, consistent with these Bylaws or with other rules that may be adopted by the Board.

## ARTICLE 5 - TRANSACTIONS OF CORPORATION
 
### 5.01 Contracts
 
The Board may authorize any officer or agent of the Corporation to enter into a contract or execute and deliver any instrument in the name of, and on behalf of, the Corporation.

### 5.02 Deposits

All the Corporation's funds will be deposited to the credit of the Corporation in banks, trust companies, or other depositories that the Board selects.
 
### 5.03 Gifts
 
The Board may accept, on the Corporation's behalf, any contribution, gift, bequest, or devise for the general purposes or for any special purpose of the Corporation. The Board may make gifts and give charitable contributions not prohibited by these Bylaws, the certificate of formation, state law, and provisions set out in federal tax law that must be complied with to maintain the Corporation's federal and state tax status.
 
### 5.04 Potential Conflicts of Interest
 
The Corporation may not make any loan to a director or officer of the Corporation. A director, officer, or committee member of the Corporation may lend money to--and otherwise transact business with--the Corporation except as otherwise provided by these Bylaws, the certificate of formation, and applicable law. Such a person transacting business with the Corporation has the same rights and obligations relating to those matters as other persons transacting business with the Corporation. The Corporation may not borrow money from--or otherwise transact business with--a director, officer, or committee member of the Corporation unless the transaction is described fully in a legally binding instrument and is in the Corporation's best interests. The Corporation may not borrow money from--or otherwise transact business with--a director, officer, or committee member of the Corporation without full disclosure of all relevant facts and without the Board's approval, not including the vote of any person having a personal interest in the transaction.
 
### 5.05 Prohibited Acts

He or she may do so through his or her attorney or other duly authorized representative. The inspection may take place at a reasonable time, no later than ten working days after the Corporation receives a proper written request. The Board may establish reasonable copying fees, which may cover the cost of materials and labor but may not exceed 25 cents per page.

## ARTICLE 7 - FISCAL YEAR
 
The Corporation's fiscal year will begin on the first day of January and end on the last day of December in each year.

## ARTICLE 8 - INDEMNIFICATION
 
### 8.01 When Indemnification Is Required, Permitted, and Prohibited

(a) The Corporation will indemnify a director, officer, committee member, employee, or agent of the Corporation who was, is, or may be named defendant or respondent in any proceeding as a result of his or her actions or omissions within the scope of his or her official capacity in the Corporation. For the purposes of this article, an agent includes one who is or was serving at the Corporation's request as a director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust, employee-benefit plan, or other enterprise.
 
(b) The Corporation will indemnify a person only if he or she acted in good faith and reasonably believed that his or her conduct was in the Corporation's best interests. In case of a criminal proceeding, the person may be indemnified only if he or she had no reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful. The Corporation will not indemnify a person who is found liable to the Corporation or is found liable to another on the basis of improperly receiving a personal benefit from the Corporation. A person is conclusively considered to have been found liable in relation to any claim, issue, or matter if the person has been adjudged liable by a court of competent jurisdiction and all appeals have been exhausted. Termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or on a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent does not necessarily preclude indemnification by the Corporation.
 
(c) The Corporation will pay or reimburse expenses incurred by a director, officer, committee member, employee, or agent of the Corporation in connection with the person's appearance as a witness or other participation in a proceeding involving or affecting the Corporation when the person is not a named defendant or respondent in the proceeding.
 
(d) In addition to the situations otherwise described in this paragraph, the Corporation may indemnify a director, officer, committee member, employee, or agent of the Corporation to the extent permitted by law. However, the Corporation will not indemnify any person in any situation in which indemnification is prohibited by paragraph 8.01(b), above.
 
(e) The corporation may advance expenses incurred or to be incurred in the defense of a proceeding to a person who might eventually be entitled to indemnification, even though there has been no final disposition of the proceeding. Advancement of expenses may occur only when the procedural conditions specified in paragraph 8.03(c), below, have been satisfied. Furthermore, the Corporation will never advance expenses to a person before final disposition of a proceeding if the person is a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding brought by the Corporation or if the person is alleged to have improperly received a personal benefit or committed other willful or intentional misconduct.
 
### 8.02 Extent and Nature of Indemnity
 
The indemnity permitted under these Bylaws includes indemnity against judgments, penalties, (including excise and similar taxes), fines, settlements, and reasonable expenses (including attorney's fees) actually incurred in connection with the proceeding. If the proceeding was brought by or on behalf of the Corporation, the indemnification is limited to reasonable expenses actually incurred by the person in connection with the proceeding.
 
### 8.03 Procedures Relating to Indemnification Payments
 
(a) Before the Corporation may pay any indemnification expenses (including attorney's fees), the Corporation must specifically determine that indemnification is permissible, authorize indemnification, and determine that expenses to be reimbursed are reasonable, except as provided in subparagraph (c), below. The Corporation may make these determinations and decisions by any one of the following procedures:
 
(i) Majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who, at the time of the vote, are not named defendants or respondents in the proceeding.
 
(ii) If such a quorum cannot be obtained, by a majority vote of a committee of the Board, designated to act in the matter by a majority vote of all directors, consisting solely of two or more directors who at the time of the vote are not named defendants or respondents in the proceeding.
 
(iii) Determination by special legal counsel selected by the Board by the same vote as provided in subsubparagraphs (i) or (ii), above, or if such a quorum cannot be obtained and such a committee cannot be established, by a majority vote of all directors.
 
(b) The Corporation will authorize indemnification and determine that expenses to be reimbursed are reasonable in the same manner that it determines whether indemnification is permissible. If special legal counsel determines that indemnification is permissible, authorization of indemnification and determination of reasonableness of expenses will be made as specified by subparagraph (a)(iii), above, governing selection of special legal counsel. A provision contained in the certificate of formation, or a resolution of members or the Board that requires the indemnification permitted by paragraph 8.01, above, constitutes sufficient authorization of indemnification even though the provision may not have been adopted or authorized in the same manner as the determination that indemnification is permissible.
 
(c) The Corporation will advance expenses before final disposition of a proceeding only after it determines that the facts then known would not preclude indemnification. The determination that the facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude indemnification and authorization of payment will be made in the same manner as a determination that indemnification is permissible under subparagraph (a), above.
 
In addition to this determination, the Corporation may advance expenses only after it receives a written affirmation and undertaking from the person to receive the advance. The person's written affirmation will state that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under these Bylaws. The written undertaking will provide for repayment of the amounts advanced by the Corporation if it is ultimately determined that the person has not met the requirements for indemnification. The undertaking will be an unlimited general obligation of the person, but it need not be secured and may be accepted without reference to financial ability to repay.

## ARTICLE 9 - NOTICES
 
### 9.01 Notice by Mail or Email

Any notice required or permitted by these Bylaws to be given to a director, officer, or member of a committee of the Corporation may be given by mail or email. If mailed, a notice is deemed delivered when deposited in the mail addressed to the person at his or her address as it appears on the corporate records, with postage prepaid. If given by email, a notice is deemed delivered when sent to the recipient’s email address as it appears on the corporate records and when no “could not deliver” notification is received by the sender in response. A person may change his or her address or email address in the corporate records by giving written notice of the change to the secretary of the corporation.
 
### 9.02 Signed Waiver of Notice

Whenever any notice is required by law or under the certificate of formation or these Bylaws, a written waiver signed by the person entitled to receive such notice is considered the equivalent to giving the required notice. A waiver of notice is effective whether signed before or after the time stated in the notice being waived.
 
### 9.03 Waiving Notice by Attendance

A person's attendance at a meeting constitutes waiver of notice of the meeting unless the person attends for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.

## ARTICLE 10 - SPECIAL PROCEDURES CONCERNING MEETINGS
 
### 10.01 Meeting by Telephone or Internet Video-Conference
 
The Board of Directors and any committee of the Corporation may hold a meeting by telephone conference-call, internet video-conference, or any combination thereof.  In all such meetings, matters must be arranged in such a manner that all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other; the notice of a meeting by telephone conference or internet video-conference must state the fact that the meeting will be held by telephone or internet video-conference as well as all other matters required to be included in the notice; and a person's participating in a conference-call meeting constitutes his or her presence at the meeting.

### 10.02 Meeting by Instant Messaging Service

The Board of Directors and any committee of the Corporation may hold a meeting via an instant messaging service, including Google Chat or any other instant messaging service approved by the Board.  In all such meetings, matters must be arranged in such a manner that all persons participating in the meeting can see and respond to the messages of every other person in the meeting.  In any meeting conducted by instant messaging service, the transcript of the discussion will be preserved and may serve as the minutes of the meeting without need for further reduction to writing.  The notice of a meeting by instant messaging service must state the fact that the meeting will be held by instant messaging service as well as all other matters required to be included in the notice.  A person's participation in the instant message chat constitutes his or her presence at the meeting.

### 10.03 Decision Without Meeting
 
Any decision required or permitted to be made at a meeting of the Board or any committee of the Corporation may be made without a meeting. A decision without a meeting may be made if a written consent to the decision is signed by all the persons entitled to vote on the matter. The original signed consents will be placed in the Corporation minute book and kept with the corporate records.
 
Furthermore, in accordance with the certificate of formation, action may be taken without a meeting when there are signed written consents by the number of members, directors, or committee members whose votes would be necessary to take action at a meeting at which all such persons entitled to vote were present and voted. Each written consent must be signed and bear the date of signature of the person signing it. A telegram, telex, cablegram, or similar transmission by a member, director, or committee member, or a photographic, facsimile, or similar reproduction of a signed writing, will be treated as an original being signed by the member, director, or committee member.
 
Consents must be delivered to the Corporation. A consent signed by fewer than all members, directors, or committee members is not effective to take the intended action unless the required number of consents are delivered to the Corporation within 60 days after the date that the earliest-dated consent was delivered to the Corporation. Delivery must be made by hand, or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. The delivery may be made to the Corporation's registered office, registered agent, principal place of business, transfer agent, registrar, exchange agent, or an officer or agent having custody of books in which the relevant proceedings are recorded. If the delivery is made to the Corporation's principal place of business, the consent must be addressed to the president or principal executive officer.
 
The Corporation will give prompt notice of the action taken to persons who do not sign consents. If the action taken requires documents to be filed with the secretary of state, the filed documents will indicate that these written consent procedures were followed to authorize the action and filing.
 
### 10.04 Proxy Voting

A person authorized to exercise a proxy may not exercise the proxy unless it is delivered to the officer presiding at the meeting before the business of the meeting begins. The secretary or other person taking the minutes of the meeting will record in the minutes the name of the person who executed the proxy and the name of the person authorized to exercise the proxy. If a person who has duly executed a proxy personally attends a meeting, the proxy will not be effective for that meeting. A proxy filed with the secretary of the Corporation or other designated officer remains in force until the first of the following occurs:
 
(a) An instrument revoking the proxy is delivered to the secretary or other designated officer.
 
(b) The proxy authority expires under the proxy's terms.
 
(c) The proxy authority expires under the terms of these Bylaws.
